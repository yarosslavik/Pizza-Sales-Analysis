# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

This Power BI project utilizes Pizza Sales data to gain comprehensive insights into sales performance over specific periods.

# About the project

Our data include vital information like: 
- pizza category 
- order ID
- order date
- order time
- pizza name  
- size
- quantity
- ingredients
- unit price
- total price
- pizza id.

We used this data to build a Power BI dashboard featuring various charts to represent the main KPIs of sales. Firstly, I used a Card to display the Average Order Value, Average Pizzas Per Order, Total Orders, Total Pizza Sold, and Total Revenue. These KPIs provide a general overview of our store's performance.

Next, I created an Area Chart to show the Monthly Trend for Total Orders, allowing us to observe order trends over time. Additionally, I developed a Column Chart representing the Total Orders for each day within the specified period.

Two Donut Charts illustrate the percentage of sales by category and size. Lastly, a chart displays the total number of pizzas sold by category.

Two blocks on the right give us general insights about our charts, helping to highlight important trends and patterns in our pizza sales data.

The next page in our Power BI dashboard is dedicated to Top and Bottom analysis. Here, we can see our Top and Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity, and total orders. This analysis helps identify our best and worst-performing pizzas, allowing us to make informed decisions to improve overall sales.
